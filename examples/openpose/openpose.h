// ------------------------- OpenPose Library Tutorial - Pose - Example 1 - Extract from Image -------------------------
// This first example shows the user how to:
// 1. Load an image (`filestream` module)
// 2. Extract the pose of that image (`pose` module)
// 3. Render the pose on a resized copy of the input image (`pose` module)
// 4. Display the rendered pose (`gui` module)
// In addition to the previous OpenPose modules, we also need to use:
// 1. `core` module: for the Array<float> class that the `pose` module needs
// 2. `utilities` module: for the error & logging functions, i.e. op::error & op::log respectively

// 3rdparty dependencies
// GFlags: DEFINE_bool, _int32, _int64, _uint64, _double, _string
